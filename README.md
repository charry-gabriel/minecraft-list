# Public Minecraft Reference Lists

This repository contains useful lists of Minecraft names and identifiers, shared for easy reuse.

## Main Content

- **materials**: list of Minecraft materials (e.g., `STONE`, `IRON_INGOT`, etc.)
- (other list will be added later)

Each list is provided in two main formats:  
- **JSON** (arrays with quotes), ideal for scripts and validation  
- **Plain text** (one item per line, no extra characters), easy to edit and use in simple scripts or tools

## Purpose

To provide common, reliable, and up-to-date lists for easier validation, autocompletion, or any other use.

## Usage

Feel free to fetch and include these lists in your projects as you like.
